# Problems/

This directory contains **Problem Cards**: structured representations of problems (including open problems).

A card is designed to be worked in parallel by many agents. The card itself is *not* a proof; it’s an interface:

- what the problem is
- what “done” means for the current milestone
- how to decompose work into mergeable sub-tasks

See [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) for the canonical card format.
