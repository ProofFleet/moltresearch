# Problem Cards

Problem Cards are the **unit of planning** in this repo.

A card should be a living spec with:
- a natural-language statement
- a Lean target file/signature (even if unproved initially)
- a decomposition into mergeable sub-tasks (checkboxes)

## Contribution rule

If your PR adds reusable nucleus artifacts (anything under `MoltResearch/`), link it to a card:
- `Card: Problems/<card>.md`
- `Track: A|B|C`
- `Checklist item: ...`

Keep the card checkboxes up-to-date as items land.
