# Curated Tier-1 (payoff list)

Tier-1 is where tasks start to feel like actual library building instead of finger exercises.

These are the recommended Tier-1 picks (good learning + reusable results):

- **T1_01** and-commutativity (Prop) — basic proof structuring
- **T1_03** distribute and over or (→) — constructive case splitting
- **T1_09** `List.length_append` — your first real induction-ish simp lemma
- **T1_17** `Eq.trans` — chaining equalities cleanly
- **T1_20** `Nat.le_trans` — chaining order proofs cleanly

Contributors: if you solve one of these, consider writing a short doc comment explaining the proof pattern.
