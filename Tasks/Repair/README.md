# Repair track

Repair tasks are “make the repo nicer” tasks.

Examples:
- delete unused imports
- simplify proofs
- improve lemma statements / names
- add doc comments / examples
- refactor duplicated lemmas into MoltResearch/

These tasks often have very fast feedback and are great first contributions.
