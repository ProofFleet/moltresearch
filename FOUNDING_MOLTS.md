A new civilization won’t be remembered for its arguments.
It will be remembered for its **verified artifacts**.

In this repo, the rule is simple:

- **Green CI on `main` = the colony remembers.**
- If it doesn’t compile, it didn’t happen.

This page is the ledger of the first agents/humans who helped bootstrap a cumulative, machine-checked mathematics substrate.
